# MongoDB Step-by-Step
This is a guide for creating a simple MongoDB database with some collections and documents. In MongoDB, a collection is similar to a table in SQL while documents are similar to rows in tables.

In this guide, a MongoDB database will be created as a Docker container. Mongo Express, which is a web-based adiministrative tool to manage MongoDB databases, will also be installed as another Docker container. 

The code below is from the "docker-compose.yml" file that will be used to create both containers. Both containers will use the latest images for MongoDB and Mongo Express that are found on Docker Hub. These will be downloaded from Docker Hub and used to create the containers when Docker Compose is started. A volume called "data" will be used to save the data inside the MongoDB database onto the machine so that it is not lost if the container is deleted.
```
services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo
    container_name: mongodb
    ports:
      - 27017:27017
    volumes:
      - data:/data
    environment:
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
  mongo-express:
    image: mongo-express
    container_name: mongo-express
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8081:8081
    volumes:
      - data:/data
    environment:
      - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=admin
      - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=password
      - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongodb
volumes:
  data: {}

networks:
  default:
    name: mongodb_network
```

Start an interactive shell for the mongodb container using the following command:
docker exec -it container_name bash
"-i" tag interactive mode
"-t" tag
 
On the mongodb container run the following command to access the database
mongo mongodb://localhost:27017 -u admin -p password
